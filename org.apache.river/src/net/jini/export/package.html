Provides generic abstractions for exporting remote objects ({@link
net.jini.export.Exporter}), obtaining a proxy from an exported remote
object ({@link net.jini.export.ProxyAccessor}), obtaining the
server-side context information for an executing remote call ({@link
net.jini.export.ServerContext}), and defining export permissions
({@link net.jini.export.ExportPermission}).  These abstractions are
independent of communication protocols, remote invocation semantics,
and other details of remote object behavior.

<a name="Requirements"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>

The <code>Exporter</code> abstraction is intended to satisfy the
following requirements:

<ul>
<li> support a variety of implementations for exporting and
unexporting remote objects using a protocol independent API
<li> support exporting a given remote object to multiple runtimes
</ul>

<a name="Exporter"><h2>Exporter</h2></a>

<p>The interface {@link net.jini.export.Exporter} is a
high-level API for both <i>exporting</i> a single remote object so
that it can receive remote method invocations, and <i>unexporting</i>
that same remote object.  Applications can use a {@link
net.jini.config.Configuration} provider together with
the <code>Exporter</code> interface to export remote objects in a way
that can be configured and deployed at run-time to use specific
implementations of the <code>Exporter</code> interface.  See the <a
href="../config/package-summary.html#Example"><code>net.jini.config</code>
package</a> documentation for examples on configurable exporting.

<p>Several implementations of the <code>Exporter</code> interface are provided:

<blockquote><table summary="Describes built-in exporter implementations"
cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>{@link net.jini.jrmp.JrmpExporter}</td>

    <td>Exports an object using the Java(TM) Remote Method Invocation
(Java RMI) implementation in Java 2, SDK, Standard Edition
(J2SE(TM)).  The behavior of remote objects exported via a
<code>JrmpExporter</code> are the same as the behavior of objects
exported via equivalent <code>exportObject</code> methods of the
<code>java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject</code> and
<code>java.rmi.activation.Activatable</code> classes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>{@link net.jini.iiop.IiopExporter}</td>

    <td>Exports an object using the Java Remote Method Invocation over
Internet-ORB Protocol technology (RMI-IIOP) in J2SE.  The behavior of
remote objects exported via an <code>IiopExporter</code> are the same
as the behavior of objects exported via the <code>exportObject</code>
method of the class <code>javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject</code> and
(where appropriate) connected to an <code>ORB</code> via the
<code>connect</code> method of <code>javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub</code>.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign=top>{@link net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriExporter}</td>
    <td>Exports an object to use Jini extensible remote invocation
(Jini ERI).  A remote object exported with
<code>BasicJeriExporter</code> can have associated custom remote
invocation and dispatch behavior, as well as a customized
communication protocol.</td>  
  </tr></table></blockquote>

<p>The details of export and unexport behavior, including
communication protocols used for remote invocation and additional
invocation semantics, are defined by the particular implementation of
the <code>Exporter</code> interface.

<p>To export a remote object, an application needs to either construct
a new instance of an <code>Exporter</code> implementation explicitly
or use the <code>Configuration.getEntry</code> method to obtain a new
instance of an <code>Exporter</code> implementation.  It is preferable
to obtain exporters via the <code>Configuration</code> provider
because doing so eliminates application code dependency on specific
<code>Exporter</code> implementations.  Only a single object can be
exported per <code>Exporter</code> instance.  Since an exporter hides
all the details of export behavior (for example, an object or
activation identifier) and such information in many cases is only
applicable to a single object, it simplifies the abstraction and the
programming model to require a new exporter per export.

<p>The <code>export</code> method exports a remote object and returns
a proxy that implements all the remote interfaces of the remote object
and that can be used to invoke remote methods on that exported remote
object.  The caller should not make any assumptions about the behavior
of the <code>Exporter</code> implementation to which the object was
exported, the implementation of the returned proxy (for example, it
need not be a "stub" class as defined in the Java RMI specification), or
the communication protocols used by the returned proxy to invoke
remote methods.

<p>A remote object exported via a given <code>Exporter</code> instance
can later be unexported by invoking the <code>unexport</code> method
of that <code>Exporter</code> instance.

<a name="ProxyAccessor"><h2>ProxyAccessor</h2></a>

<p>The interface {@link net.jini.export.ProxyAccessor} provides a
means to obtain a proxy for an exported remote object and is typically
used in conjunction with activatable remote objects.  An activatable
remote object should implement this interface so that the activation
group can obtain the remote object's proxy once the remote object is
created (activated) and exported.  If an activatable remote object
does not implement this interface, it must define a constructor that
takes as arguments an {@link java.rmi.activation.ActivationID} and a
{@link java.rmi.MarshalledObject}, and it must be serializable and
marshalling the object produces a suitable proxy for the remote
object.

<a name="ServerContext"><h2>ServerContext</h2></a>

<p>The class {@link net.jini.export.ServerContext}
provides a generic API for associating and obtaining server context
information for a remote call executing in the current thread.

The class contains static methods for obtaining the server context for
the current thread (<code>ServerContext.getServerContext</code>) and
for executing some action within a given server context
(<code>ServerContext.doWithServerContext</code>).  In addition, the
<code>ServerContext</code> class provides the interface {@link
net.jini.export.ServerContext.Spi} for server context
providers that are consulted to obtain a server context if one is not
already associated with the current thread via the
<code>ServerContext.doWithServerContext</code> method.

<p>The context information available from a given element of the
collection is determined by that element's type.  Examples of types
that a given element might implement include:

<ul>
<li>{@link net.jini.io.context.ClientHost}
<li>{@link net.jini.io.context.ClientSubject}
<li>{@link net.jini.io.context.IntegrityEnforcement}
</ul>

<p>A remote object does not itself set up a <code>ServerContext</code>,
rather the <code>Exporter</code> implementation that
dispatches incoming calls to its exported remote objects may establish
one for each call that it services.

<p>For supplying context information for remote method execution, the
<code>BasicJeriExporter</code> implementation uses the method
<code>doWithServerContext</code> and the <code>JrmpExporter</code>
implementation uses the provider interface
<code>ServerContext.Spi</code>.  The <code>IiopExporter</code>
implementation does not support the <code>ServerContext</code> API in
supplying context information for incoming calls dispatched to its
exported objects.

<a name="ExportPermission"><h2>ExportPermission</h2></a>

<p>The class {@link net.jini.export.ExportPermission}
defines runtime permissions associated with export-related
operations.  When invoking {@link
net.jini.jeri.AbstractILFactory#getInvocationDispatcherMethods}, the calling
context must have been granted the permission
<code>ExportPermission("exportRemoteInterface.<i>interfaceName</i>")</code>
for each non-public remote interface the supplied remote object
implements.
