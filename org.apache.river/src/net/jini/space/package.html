JavaSpaces servers provide a place on the network, a <em>space</em>,
for clients to store and exchange objects. Sets of processes in a
distributed system can coordinate their actions by flowing objects in and
out of the space. Because these processes interact via the space they can
be decoupled from each other. The basic {@link net.jini.space.JavaSpace}
interface allows objects, called {@linkplain net.jini.core.entry
<em>entries</em>} to be copied into, removed from, and/or non-destructively
copied out of the space - optionally using {@linkplain
net.jini.core.transaction Jini technology-based transactions}. <p>

The basic <code>JavaSpace</code> interface is specified in the <a
href=http://www.jini.org/standards/index.html> JavaSpaces Service
Specification</a>.<p>

The {@link net.jini.space.JavaSpace05} interface extends the
<code>JavaSpace</code> interface to provide methods that allow clients to
perform batch operations on the space (which are generally more efficient
than performing an equivalent set of singleton operations) and to more
easily develop applications where a given <code>Entry</code> needs to be
read by multiple clients.  Implementations of the <code>JavaSpace</code>
interface are not required to implement this interface.<p>
