Provides support for the HTTPMD URL protocol. <p>

HTTPMD URLs provide a way to insure the integrity of data retrieved from
an HTTP URL. The HTTPMD URL includes a message digest for the data to be
retrieved from the URL. The URL input stream insures that the data has
the correct message digest when the end of file for the stream is
reached. <p>

The {@link net.jini.url.httpmd.Handler} class defines a stream handler
for HTTPMD URLs. You can specify that this class be used for HTTPMD URLs
by setting the "java.protocol.handler.pkgs" system property to
"net.jini.url". See {@link java.net.URL#URL(java.lang.String,
java.lang.String, int, java.lang.String)} for more details on specifying
a URL stream protocol handler. <p>

The {@link net.jini.url.httpmd.HttpmdIntegrityVerifier} class defines an
integrity verifier for HTTPMD URLs. This class is intended to be
specified in a resource to configure the operation of {@link
net.jini.security.Security#verifyCodebaseIntegrity
Security.verifyCodebaseIntegrity}. <p>

The {@link net.jini.url.httpmd.HttpmdUtil} class provides utility
methods for computing the message digest of data specified by a URL and
for computing HTTPMD URLs for use in codebases.

@since 2.0
@version 2.0

@org.apache.river.impl <!-- Implementation Specifics -->

This implementation of HTTPMD URLs uses the {@link
java.util.logging.Logger} named <code>net.jini.url.httpmd</code> to log
information at the following logging levels: <p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" summary="Describes logging performed
       by the HTTPMD URL handler at different logging levels">

<caption halign="center" valign="top"><b><code>
	 net.jini.url.httpmd</code></b></caption>

<tr> <th scope="col"> Level <th scope="col"> Description

<tr> <td> {@link org.apache.river.logging.Levels#FAILED FAILED} <td> URL
     input stream detects an incorrect message digest

</table> <p>

See the {@link org.apache.river.logging.LogManager} class for one way to use
the <code>FAILED</code> logging level in standard logging configuration
files.
