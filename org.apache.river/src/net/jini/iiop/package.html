Provides an {@link net.jini.export.Exporter} implementation,
{@link net.jini.iiop.IiopExporter}, that can be used to export
and unexport 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/rmi-iiop/">RMI-IIOP</a> remote
objects.

<code>IiopExporter</code> acts as an adapter between existing methods for
(un)exporting and connecting remote objects via RMI-IIOP (e.g.,
{@link javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject#exportObject}, 
{@link javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub#connect}) and the
<code>Exporter</code> interface.  By performing export
and unexport operations through 
{@link net.jini.config.Configuration}-provided
<code>Exporter</code> instances, applications can be configured and deployed at
run-time to use <code>IiopExporter</code> and/or other <code>Exporter</code>
implementations.  See the {@link net.jini.config} package
documentation for examples on configurable exporting.

@since 2.0
