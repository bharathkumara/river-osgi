Provides mechanisms and abstractions for managing security, especially in the
presence of dynamically downloaded code. The mechanisms include:
<ul>
<li>A provider-based mechanism for clients to verify that proxies can be
trusted
<li>A provider-based mechanism for verifying code integrity
<li>A provider-based mechanism for clients to dynamically grant permissions
to proxies
</ul>

<a name="programming_model"></a><h2>Programming Model</h2>

When a client obtains a proxy from somewhere, normally the client should
follow these three steps before making any remote calls through the proxy or
handing any sensitive data to the proxy:
<ul>
<li>Verify that the proxy can be <a href="#proxy_trust">trusted</a>
<li>Attach client
<a href="../core/constraint/package-summary.html#constraints">constraints</a>
to (a copy of) the proxy
<li><a href="#dynamic_grants">Grant</a> permissions (such as
{@link net.jini.security.AuthenticationPermission}) to the
proxy
</ul>
The first step can be accomplished using
{@link net.jini.security.Security#verifyObjectTrust
Security.verifyObjectTrust}. The second step can be accomplished using
{@link
net.jini.core.constraint.RemoteMethodControl#setConstraints
RemoteMethodControl.setConstraints};
{@link net.jini.constraint.BasicMethodConstraints} is a basic
implementation of
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.MethodConstraints}. The last
step can be accomplished using
{@link net.jini.security.Security#grant Security.grant}.
<p>
Normally the client should be written in such a way that it can be configured
to allow for variations in the steps used to prepare a proxy for subsequent
use. The usual way is to obtain a
{@link net.jini.security.ProxyPreparer} from a
{@link net.jini.config.Configuration}, using as a default value
a {@link net.jini.security.BasicProxyPreparer} that simply
returns the proxy. The client can then be configured at deployment time to
perform whatever steps are desired.
<pre>
Configuration config = ...;
SomeService proxy = ...;
ProxyPreparer preparer = (ProxyPreparer) config.getEntry(
				"MyClient", "someServicePreparer",
				ProxyPreparer.class, new BasicProxyPreparer());
proxy = (SomeService) preparer.prepareProxy(proxy);
</pre>
<p>
{@link net.jini.security.BasicProxyPreparer} can be used to
perform all combinations of these three common steps of proxy preparation.

<a name="proxy_trust"></a><h2>Proxy Trust</h2>

The basic proxy trust issue can be seen with an example. Suppose the client
wants to make a remote call through a proxy. The proxy implements the
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.RemoteMethodControl} interface,
and the client attaches constraints to the proxy, requiring the server to
authenticate as a particular principal. If the proxy code has been dynamically
downloaded, and the client does nothing to verify that it trusts the proxy,
then the downloaded code might simply ignore the client's constraints and
perform no authentication at all. The proxy code might also corrupt the data
being passed in the call, or perform some other unintended operation.
<p>
The client needs some way to decide that it trusts a proxy. Rather than
mandating any specific mechanism(s), a pluggable framework is provided.
The client calls
{@link net.jini.security.Security#verifyObjectTrust
Security.verifyObjectTrust}, passing the proxy and a caller context collection
that typically contains a
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.MethodConstraints} instance.
This method uses whatever
{@link net.jini.security.TrustVerifier} instances have been
configured to determine if the proxy can be trusted; if any verifier says
that it trusts the proxy, then the proxy is assumed to be trusted. If no
verifier trusts the proxy, a <code>SecurityException</code> is thrown. The
caller context collection contains whatever context information might be
required by verifiers; a <code>MethodConstraints</code> element in the
collection is typically used to control any calls to the remote server that
are made by verifiers.
<p>
A baseline for deciding a proxy can be trusted is to examine the proxy and
all of its constituent objects, excluding the client constraints, to ensure
that they are all instances of locally trusted (typically, not downloaded)
classes, containing trusted data. For example,
{@link net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriTrustVerifier} provides this
baseline for basic dynamic proxies of remote objects exported to use Jini
extensible remote invocation (Jini ERI), in conjunction with
{@link net.jini.constraint.ConstraintTrustVerifier}, which
verifies the standard constraints.
{@link net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrustVerifier} depends
on this baseline as a bootstrap, but ultimately asks the server if it trusts
the proxy.
<p>
The client constraints are excluded from the trust verification of a proxy
because it is assumed that the caller will subsequently either replace them
with its own constraints that are known to be trusted, or has independently
decided to trust the existing client constraints.
<p>
Note that trust verification does not prevent denial-of-service attacks. If a
proxy that uses untrusted code is unmarshalled, the untrusted code can execute
before trust verification takes place. In deployments where the trusted
sources of downloaded code are known in advance, the
{@link net.jini.loader.pref.RequireDlPermProvider} can be used
to prevent code downloading from untrusted sources.

<a name="dynamic_grants"></a><h2>Dynamic Permission Grants</h2>

Once a client decides that it trusts a proxy, it may need to grant additional
permissions (such as
{@link net.jini.security.AuthenticationPermission}) to that
proxy, so that subsequent calls to the proxy operate correctly. It is
important to delay granting such permissions until after the trust decision,
so that an untrusted proxy cannot abuse the grants in a way that might cause
harm.
<p>
Dynamic grants require support from the {@link java.security.Policy} provider.
The {@link net.jini.security.policy} package provides a standard
interface for security policy providers capable of dynamic permission grants,
as well as a set of composable security policy providers supporting dynamic
permission grants and aggregation of multiple security policies in a single
virtual machine.
<p>
{@link net.jini.security.Security#grantSupported
Security.grantSupported} can be used to determine if the installed security
policy supports dynamic grants, and
{@link net.jini.security.Security#grant Security.grant} can
be used to make dynamic permission grants. The typical use is to grant
permissions to the class loader of the proxy object's top-level class,
coupled with the principals of the currently executing subject:
<pre>
SomeService proxy = ...;
Permission[] grants = ...;
Security.grant(proxy.getClass(), grants);
</pre>
In order to dynamically grant a permission, the client itself must have the
corresponding {@link net.jini.security.GrantPermission}.
Because the dynamic grant is coupled with the current subject, proxy code must
assume that actions executed using
{@link java.security.AccessController#doPrivileged
AccessController.doPrivileged} will not have the granted permissions (because
that method executes the action with no subject);
{@link net.jini.security.Security#doPrivileged
Security.doPrivileged} should be used instead to maintain the current subject
and thereby enable privileges in a way that retains the granted permissions.

<a name="code_integrity"></a><h2>Code Integrity</h2>

As described in the {@link net.jini.core.constraint.Integrity}
constraint class, for a remote call to have integrity, both code and data must
have integrity, and a common technique is to use codebase URLs that provide
content integrity. Rather than mandating which URLs provide content integrity,
a pluggable framework is provided, and
{@link net.jini.security.Security#verifyCodebaseIntegrity
Security.verifyCodebaseIntegrity} can be used to determine if all of the
URLs in a codebase provide content integrity, based on whatever
{@link net.jini.security.IntegrityVerifier} instances
have been configured. Application code normally does not call this method
directly; rather, it is called by the input streams (such as
{@link net.jini.io.MarshalInputStream}) used to unmarshal
objects during a remote call. The
{@link net.jini.url.httpmd.HttpmdIntegrityVerifier},
{@link net.jini.url.https.HttpsIntegrityVerifier}, and
{@link net.jini.url.file.FileIntegrityVerifier} classes are
provided to verify the integrity of HTTPMD, HTTPS, and FILE URLs, respectively.
