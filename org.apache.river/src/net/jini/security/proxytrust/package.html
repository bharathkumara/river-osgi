Defines a trust verifier to support verification of proxies that use
dynamically downloaded code, implementation mechanisms to support the
verification of such proxies, and an exporter for remote objects that have
such proxies. The trust verifier is intended to be specified in a resource to
configure the operation of
{@link net.jini.security.Security#verifyObjectTrust
Security.verifyObjectTrust}.
<p>
The purpose of this package is to support verification of proxies that use
dynamically downloaded code, in a way that limits the knowledge that must be
pre-configured into the client. Specifically, the idea is to require the
client to only know who the server must authenticate as (which is something
the client presumably needs to know anyway), to avoid requiring the client to
know anything else (such as where the code was downloaded from or who signed
that code), and to avoid making assumptions about the authentication
mechanism (such as requiring the server to have a public/private key pair
that it has to use for signing the proxy code).
<p>
Rather than having the client directly determine if it trusts the proxy,
the approach taken is to first determine that the client can trust the server
(by requiring the server to authenticate itself), and then determine that the
server trusts the proxy (by asking the server for a verifier and passing the
proxy to that verifier). If the client trusts the server and the server
trusts the proxy, then transitively the client is inferred to trust the
proxy. However, there are questions to answer for both of these steps.
<p>
First, there is the question of how the client can reliably verify that the
server authenticates itself, when the client does not yet trust the
downloaded proxy. The
{@link net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrustVerifier}
requires the proxy to support some bootstrap remote communication mechanism
that the client does trust. Specifically, the proxy must be able to provide a
bootstrap proxy, which must be an instance of both
{@link net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrust} and
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.RemoteMethodControl}. This
bootstrap proxy either must be trusted by the client, or it must be a
dynamic proxy which is trusted by the client after removing remote codebase
information from the dynamic proxy class. In the common case of a smart
proxy wrapped around a standard dynamic proxy (for example, a dynamic proxy
for a remote object exported to use Jini extensible remote invocation
(Jini ERI)), the dynamic proxy usually can serve as the bootstrap proxy if
its invocation handler does not depend on any downloaded code, on the
assumption that the client will have configured in a trust verifier for local
dynamic proxies and their invocation handlers (for example,
{@link net.jini.jeri.BasicJeriTrustVerifier}). However, there
is no requirement that normal communication with the server use the same
protocol used by the bootstrap proxy; the bootstrap proxy could be used
strictly for trust verification. The
{@link net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrustExporter}
is provided for this purpose.
<p>
Second, there is the question of how to reliably obtain a verifier from the
server. (The proxy is not sent to the server because an untrusted proxy
could use a <code>writeReplace</code> serialization method to replace
itself on the wire with a trusted proxy; the proxy needs to be checked in
the client.) Authentication of the server should be required during the
remote call through the bootstrap proxy to obtain the verifier from the
server, as should object integrity, so that the remote call and the
verifier object received from it can be trusted. To accomplish this,
the client is responsible for specifying
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ServerAuthentication#YES
ServerAuthentication.YES}, an appropriate
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.ServerMinPrincipal} instance,
and {@link net.jini.core.constraint.Integrity#YES Integrity.YES}
as requirements for the
{@link net.jini.security.proxytrust.ProxyTrust#getProxyVerifier
ProxyTrust.getProxyVerifier} method in a
{@link net.jini.core.constraint.MethodConstraints} instance
included as an element of the context collection passed to
<code>Security.verifyObjectTrust</code>. Normally such constraints should be
obtained from a {@link net.jini.config.Configuration} rather
than being explicitly constructed.
