These are the transaction abstraction's interfaces and classes.  These types
define a two-phase commit protocol for driving transactions in a
distributed system.  These types define the actors and actions in the
protocol but not the transaction semantics or transaction participant
interactions with the manager.  These are defined by particular
implementations of the <CODE>Transaction</CODE> and
<CODE>NestableTransaction</CODE> interfaces.  The default semantics
and participant/manager interactions are defined in the subpackage
<CODE>net.jini.core.transaction.server</CODE>.
