These are the default transaction semantics for participant/manager interaction.
The <CODE>ServerTransaction</CODE> class implements the
<CODE>Transaction</CODE> interface.  Users of a
<CODE>ServerTransaction</CODE> are guaranteed ACID properties in the
transactions.  Participants and transaction managers will interact with
<CODE>TransactionParticipant</CODE> and <CODE>TransactionManager</CODE>
(and <CODE>NestableTransactionManager</CODE>) interfaces defined here.
