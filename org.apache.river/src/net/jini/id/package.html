Provides classes and interfaces for using universally unique
identifiers.

<h2><code>Uuid</code> and <code>UuidFactory</code></h2>

<p>Instances of the class {@link net.jini.id.Uuid} are universally
unique identifiers.  A <code>Uuid</code> is a 128-bit value.  The
class {@link net.jini.id.UuidFactory} provides static methods for
creating <code>Uuid</code> instances with specified values and newly
generated values.

<p>The design of the <code>Uuid</code> and <code>UuidFactory</code>
classes is intended to allow the actual class of a <code>Uuid</code>
instance to be <i>preferred</i> (see {@link net.jini.loader.pref}), to
help preserve that class's codebase annotation when it gets
unmarshalled, while the <code>Uuid</code> class itself is not
preferred, so that <code>Uuid</code> can be used in public field,
method, and constructor declarations of types resolvable by classes
defined by different class loaders.

<h2><code>ReferentUuid</code> and <code>ReferentUuids</code></h2>

<p>The interface {@link net.jini.id.ReferentUuid} allows a proxy for a
resource to express the identity of that resource as a
<code>Uuid</code>.  The class {@link net.jini.id.ReferentUuids}
provides a static convenience method for comparing the identities of
proxies that are instances of <code>ReferentUuid</code>.  With a
uniform interface for accessing the identity of a proxy's resource,
two proxies can be recognized as being for the same resource even if
the proxies' implementation classes are not the same version or not
defined by the same class loader.
