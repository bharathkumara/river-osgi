Provides a {@link net.jini.config.Configuration} interface for obtaining
objects needed to configure applications, such as {@link
net.jini.export.Exporter} or {@link net.jini.security.ProxyPreparer}
instances, or other application-specific objects, from configuration
files, databases, or other sources. Application developers are
encouraged to use this interface, rather than explicitly constructing
instances of exporters and proxy preparers, so that applications can be
customized without requiring code modifications. Applications should
normally use {@link net.jini.config.ConfigurationProvider} to obtain
<code>Configuration</code> instances, so that the interpretation of
configuration options can be customized without requiring code
modifications. <p>

The {@link net.jini.config.ConfigurationException} class is the
superclass of all exceptions thrown if a problem occurs when obtaining
configuration information. {@link net.jini.config.NoSuchEntryException}
is the subclass thrown for a missing configuration entry. {@link
net.jini.config.ConfigurationNotFoundException} is the subclass thrown
for missing configuration source locations and if default options are
requested but not available. <p>

The {@link net.jini.config.ConfigurationFile} class is the standard
default configuration provider, which reads text written in a subset of
the expression syntax in the Java(TM) programming language from files
and URLs to produce configuration objects. <p>

The {@link net.jini.config.AbstractConfiguration} class is a skeletal
implementation of the <code>Configuration</code> interface, used to
simplify writing implementations. <p>

The {@link net.jini.config.EmptyConfiguration} class implements a
<code>Configuration</code> with no entries. Applications can use an
instance of this class to simplify handling cases where no configuration
is specified rather than, for example, checking for a <code>null</code>
configuration. <p>
    
The net.jini.config.GroovyConfig class is a new configuration provider,
it uses Groovy configuration objects, this is potentially the most
powerful configuration mechanism. <p>

<a name="Usage"><h2>Using Configuration</h2></a>

Once an application gets a <code>Configuration</code> using
<code>ConfigurationProvider</code> or through an application-specific
mechanism, the application should pass that configuration to other
subsystems that need configuration information, in addition to using it
for its own needs. This arrangement provides the user with a uniform way
to supply configuration information to all the components that make up
an application. <p>

The names that applications and subsystems use for configuration entries
should be chosen carefully to avoid conflicts. One possible approach is
to use fully qualified class names as the component for configurable
applications and utilities, and to use fully qualified package names as
the component for services. For each entry, the decision should be made
whether to supply a default or to throw
<code>NoSuchEntryException</code> if there is no matching
entry. Components should document which configuration entries they use,
as well as the expected type and default, if any, for each entry. <p>

<a name="Example"><h2>Example</h2></a>

Here is a sketch of how to use these facilities for an application with
configurable exporting. The class below shows exporting an object using
a <code>Configuration</code>: <p>

<pre>
    import java.rmi.*;
    import net.jini.config.*;
    import net.jini.export.*;
    public class Example implements Remote {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
            Configuration config = ConfigurationProvider.getInstance(args);
            Exporter exporter = (Exporter) config.getEntry(
                "Example", "exporter", Exporter.class);
            Remote proxy = exporter.export(new Example());
            System.out.println(proxy);
            exporter.unexport(true);
        }
    }
</pre> <p>

Here are the contents of a <code>ConfigurationFile</code> source file to
export the object using an JRMP exporter: <p>

<pre>
    import net.jini.jrmp.*;
    Example {
        exporter = new JrmpExporter();
    }
</pre> <p>

Here are the contents of another <code>ConfigurationFile</code> to
export the object using a Jini extensible remote invocation (Jini
ERI) exporter over HTTP on a specific port: <p>

<pre>
    import net.jini.jeri.*;
    import net.jini.jeri.http.*;
    Example {
        exporter = new BasicJeriExporter(HttpServerEndpoint.getInstance(12000));
    }
</pre> <p>

This application can be configured to export the object in either of
these ways (or more with other configuration files) by passing an
argument that specifies the location of one of the configuration files:

<pre>
    java Example jrmp.config

    java Example jeri.config
</pre>

<font size="+1"><b>Loggers and Logging Levels</b></font>
</a><p>

This implementation of the <code>ConfigurationProvider</code>,
<code>AbstractConfiguration</code>, <code>ConfigurationFile</code>, and
<code>EmptyConfiguration</code> classes uses the {@link
java.util.logging.Logger} named <code>net.jini.config</code> to log
information at the following logging levels: <p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" summary="Describes logging performed
       by configuration classes at different logging levels">

<caption halign="center" valign="top"><b><code>
	 net.jini.config</code></b></caption>

<tr> <th scope="col"> Level <th scope="col"> Description

<tr> <td> {@link java.util.logging.Level#INFO INFO} <td> problems adding new
     prohibited methods for <code>ConfigurationFile</code>

<tr> <td> {@link org.apache.river.logging.Levels#FAILED FAILED} <td> problems
     getting a configuration using <code>ConfigurationProvider</code>,
     or problems getting entries, including getting entries that are not
     found, from the configuration implementation classes

<tr> <td> {@link java.util.logging.Level#FINE FINE} <td> returning default
     values from the configuration implementation classes

<tr> <td> {@link java.util.logging.Level#FINER FINER} <td> getting existing
     entries from the configuration implementation classes, creating a
     <code>ConfigurationFile</code>, or adding new prohibited methods
     for <code>ConfigurationFile</code>

See the {@link org.apache.river.logging.LogManager} class for one way to use
the <code>FAILED</code> logging level in standard logging configuration
files.
