Provides interfaces and utility classes related to dynamic class
loading with {@link java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader}.  Some of these
APIs depend on support that is not required of all
<code>RMIClassLoader</code> providers.

<p>The {@link net.jini.loader.ClassAnnotation} interface may be
implemented by a {@link java.lang.ClassLoader} to customize the
behavior of {@link java.rmi.server.RMIClassLoader#getClassAnnotation
RMIClassLoader.getClassAnnotation} for classes defined by an instance
of such a class loader (if <code>ClassAnnotation</code> is supported
by the current <code>RMIClassLoader</code> provider).

<p>{@link net.jini.loader.DownloadPermission} can be used to restrict
the {@link java.security.CodeSource} values (codebase URLs and
signers) with which downloaded classes can be defined using
<code>RMIClassLoader</code> (if <code>DownloadPermission</code> is
supported by the current <code>RMIClassLoader</code> provider).

<p>{@link net.jini.loader.ClassLoading} provides static methods for
loading classes using <code>RMIClassLoader</code> with optional
verification that the codebase URLs used to load classes provide
content integrity.
