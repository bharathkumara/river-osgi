/**
 * Interface implemented by event storage objects.
 * This class encapsulates the details of reading/writing events from/to
 * some underlying persistence mechanism.
 *
 * This interface makes certain assumptions. First, the <tt>next</tt> and
 * <tt>remove</tt> methods are intended to be called in pairs. If 
 * <tt>remove</tt> is not called, then subsequent calls to <tt>next</tt> 
 * will attempt to return the same object. Calling <tt>remove</tt> 
 * essentially advances the read pointer to the next object, if any. 
 * Second, if any <tt>IOExceptions</tt> are encountered during the reading
 * or writing of an event the associated read/write pointer is advanced
 * past the offending event. This means that events can be lost if I/O 
 * errors are encountered.
