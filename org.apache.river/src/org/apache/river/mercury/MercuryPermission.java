/**
 * Represents permissions that can be used to express the access control policy

 * and then used in
 * security policy permission grants. <p>

 * An instance contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but no
 * actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't. The
 * convention is that the target name is the non-qualified name of the remote
 * method being invoked. Wildcard matches are supported using the syntax
 * specified by {@link AccessPermission}. <p>
 *
 * The possible target names for use with a Mercury server are specified in the
 * package documentation for {@link org.apache.river.mercury}.
