Provides a set of constraints, low-level utility classes, and provider
interfaces for participating in versions 1 and 2 of the multicast request,
multicast announcement, and unicast discovery protocols.
<p>
The {@link org.apache.river.discovery.DiscoveryProtocolVersion},
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastMaxPacketSize},
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastTimeToLive} and
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.UnicastSocketTimeout} classes represent
constraints which can be applied to multicast and unicast discovery.  The
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.DiscoveryConstraints} class offers convenience
methods for querying the values expressed by groups of these constraints.  The
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.Discovery} class provides methods implementing
various low-level discovery protocol operations, such as encoding and decoding
multicast packet contents and unicast discovery data.  These methods accept as
arguments instances of the {@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastRequest},
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastAnnouncement} and
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.UnicastResponse} classes, which represent the
values (independent of protocol details) to be transmitted by multicast
requests, multicast announcements, and unicast discovery.
<p>
The <code>Discovery</code> class implements both versions 1 and 2 of the
discovery protocols.  For version 2 of the protocols, it accepts pluggable
format providers, specified via resource using the
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.DiscoveryFormatProvider} interface, which
implement the {@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastRequestEncoder},
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastRequestDecoder},
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastAnnouncementEncoder},
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.MulticastAnnouncementDecoder},
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.UnicastDiscoveryClient}, and
{@link org.apache.river.discovery.UnicastDiscoveryServer} format provider
sub-interfaces.
