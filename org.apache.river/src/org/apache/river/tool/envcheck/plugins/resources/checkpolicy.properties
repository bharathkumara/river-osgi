policyfile=security policy file

badtask=Exception returned by sub process {0}

policyprop=java.security.policy system property

for=policy file {0} in service descriptor for {1}

policyExp=A security policy file should be specified via the \
          java.security.policy system property. RMI requires a \
          security manager to be installed before remote calls can \
          be made; the default set of permissions is generally insufficient, \
          so a customized policy file is usually required.

nopolicy=No security policy file is defined

policyOK=A security policy file is defined and accessible

grantsall=Security policy globally grants AllPermissions

allExp=A security policy which grants java.security.AllPermissions \
       to all protection domains should not be used for \
       deployment.

parseerror=Syntax error discovered in policy file: {0}

cmdpolicy=policy file {0} from system property java.security.policy
