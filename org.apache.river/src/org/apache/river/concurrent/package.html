            <p>Custard-apple is a utility that enables weak, soft, strong 
            or time references to be used in any collection implementing standard
            Java Framework Interfaces</p>
            <p>Expected behaviour of reference types may vary between platforms
            and should not be depended upon other than; weak references will 
            be collected when no further strong references remain and soft
            references may be collected at any time the JVM's available memory 
            is under pressure and the referent is softly reachable.  Time
            references should exhibit identical behaviour on all platforms and
            will be collected after a period of inactivity, even while strong
            references to those objects remain.</p>
            <p>Due to the multi threaded nature of Custard-apple the 
            garbage collection thread may not see timestamp updates on soft
            references when reading objects from collections, possibly causing those
            soft references to be collected earlier than expected.</p>
            <p>Large memory heaps cause issues with soft references in the Oracle
            jvm, in this case use -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=1 to minimise 
            GC issues.  At least until bug 6912889 is fixed.</p>
            <p>Cliff Click's highly scalable hash map has been tested with
            Custard-apple, also designed with scalability in mind.
            Cleaning of garbage collected objects from collections is performed
            by a background executor periodically.  Internal implementations
            produce significant quantities of short lived objects during
            read operations that die young.  These objects only ever live in
            CPU cache, are not written back to shared memory and are never
            shared between threads.</p>
            <p>Although Custard-apple is intended to be scalable it
            has not been tested on highly scalable hardware, if you have
            access to such hardware, feel free to write tests and
            contribute back performance improvements.</p>
            <p>Timed references are provided for caching purposes and also
            support cancellation of Future's, for example timed references can
            be used in Queue's as a throttling mechanism, similar to a
            network dropping packets.  Referent Future tasks will be cancelled by the
            cleaning thread when enqueued.</p>
            <p>Serialization support for Map's will be implemented in a future
            release.  Serialization of other collection types is supported,
            provided the underlying collection also supports Serialization.</p>
            <p>Serialized form has been implemented as a separate concern
                using the 
                <link><i><a href="http://wiki.apache.org/river/Serialization">
                            Serialization Builder Pattern</a></i>
            with the readResolve() workaround.
            </p>
            <p>Package private implementation classes are not tied to
            serial form.  These classes are not published by implementing
            Serializable. Future versions of this library, may 
            utilise a completely different class or classes upon deserialisation.
            The serial form may also change between releases in ways that would
            normally break compatibility, multiple serial forms may exist for
            one class in multiple versions of it, without ever breaking
            compatibility.  Currently all classes that implement Collection
            share an identical serial form.</p>
            <p>Serialization compatibility is guaranteed between different releases.</p>
